# Tales
Swift 앱에 처음으로 LAMP 스택을 백엔드로 적용해 보고 AVFoundation을 사용해 본 Audio Book 토이 프로젝트입니다.
소중한 사람의 목소리를 담은 오디오북을 만들고 싶다는 생각을 가지고 시작 했습니다. 향후 iOS 개발 실력을 향상시키고 디자이너와 협업하여 퀄리티 있는 앱으로 발전시키고 싶습니다.

Tales is a toy project that I used for my Database class. 
We were required to strictly use MySQL for the term project.


The objective of the app was to provide customizable audio book where users can record their own or their loved one's voice. This can ultimately result in users having their own custom audiobook. As this app was developed when I had no idea about Swift, I will defeinitly be working on it in the future.
## Roadmap

- v0.1 Made for term project in Database class.
